# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Exponential Smoothing and Holt-Winters in Python - Created by Diogo Alves de Resende

##  Lab scenario
As a data analyst at Diogo's Delicious Chocolate Company (DDCC), you have been assigned a time series forecasting project by your manager who heads the supply chain team. The company has been facing issues in the supply chain where some chocolates sell out too quickly, while others sit in inventory for 2 years. Therefore, DDCC is trying to optimize its production and inventory management, however, accurate forecasts of chocolate demand are crucial for this purpose. The project will start with a financial forecast for the next 3 months. Your manager has asked you to use exponential smoothing and Holt-Winters methods to develop reliable forecasts of chocolate sales for the next quarter. You will be working closely with the sales and marketing teams, who will provide you with historical sales data as well as any relevant information about promotions and other demand drivers. You are expected to deliver a report with your findings, including recommendations, to the supply chain team and a Python codebase that can be used to generate updated forecasts on a regular basis. Your manager will be looking for clear and concise communication of the methods, results, and accuracy of your forecasts.

## Objectives
- Implement exponential smoothing and Holt-Winters in Python using appropriate libraries
- Identify and handle seasonality in time series data using Holt-Winters
- Analyze the performance of exponential smoothing and Holt-Winters models using evaluation metrics such as mean, absolute error, and root mean squared error
- Use exponential smoothing and Holt-Winters to forecast short-term and long-term trends in time series data
- Use exponential smoothing and Holt-Winters to make informed decisions based on forecasts in business and industry settings
- Communicate the results and implications of exponential smoothing and Holt-Winters forecasts effectively to technical and non-technical audiences

## Skills
